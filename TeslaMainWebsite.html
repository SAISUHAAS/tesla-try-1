There were four planned powertrain configurations for the Model Y: Standard Range Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD), Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, Long Range with Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive (AWD), and Performance (with Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive). The Long Range AWD model and the Performance model are currently being delivered. The Standard Range RWD configuration was initially canceled in July 2020, due to the range (230 miles EPA) being unacceptably low to Musk, but is now orderable (with 244 miles of EPA range). As of February 3, 2021, the Long Range RWD appears to have been cancelled.</h4></p>

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that Roadster sales will begin after the release of the revised Model S 'Plaid', starting production in 2022. Musk said in a tweet that higher-performance trim levels will be available beyond the base specifications, including a SpaceX package which would "include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around the car" which would supposedly allow for dramatic improvements in "acceleration, top speed, braking & cornering", and even the possibility of flight.  </h4></p>
